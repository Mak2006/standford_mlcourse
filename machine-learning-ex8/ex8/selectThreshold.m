    % ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    % Instructions: Compute the F1 score of choosing epsilon as the
    %               threshold and place the value in F1. The code at the
    %               end of the loop will compare the F1 score for this
    %               choice of epsilon and set it to be the best epsilon if
    %               it is better than the current choice of epsilon.
    %               
    % Note: You can use predictions = (pval < epsilon) to get a binary vector
    %       of 0's and 1's of the outlier predictions

% F1, PREC, recall formules are simple ratios.

tp is the number of true positives: the ground truth label says it's an
anomaly and our algorithm correctly classied it as an anomaly.
• fp is the number of false positives: the ground truth label says it's not
an anomaly, but our algorithm incorrectly classied it as an anomaly.
• fn is the number of false negatives: the ground truth label says it's an
anomaly, but our algorithm incorrectly classied it as not being anoma-
lous.
