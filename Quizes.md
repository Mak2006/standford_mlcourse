Week 5 quiz

Accuracy = (true positives + true negatives) / (total examples)
Precision = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)
Recall = (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives)
F_1  score = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
![DATA SET](https://i.imgur.com/8SVdeC3.png)
accuracy =  85 + 10/1000 = 0.095
precision = (85)/(85 + 15)  = 0.85
recall 	  = (85 )/(85+890)  = 0.087
F1 = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
   = 2*0.85*0.087/(0.85 + 0.087)= 0.1578

**2nd prob**
Suppose you are working on a spam classifier, where spamemails are positive examples (y=1y=1) and non-spam emails arenegative examples (y=0y=0). You have a training set of emailsin which 99% of the emails are non-spam and the other 1% isspam. Which of the following statements are true? Check all
that apply.

a - If you always predict spam (output  y=1y=1),your classifier will have a recall of 0% and precisionof 99%.
b - If you always predict non-spam (outputy=0y=0), your classifier will have a recall of0%.
c - If you always predict non-spam (outputy=0y=0), your classifier will have an accuracy of99%.
d - If you always predict spam (output  y=1y=1),your classifier will have a recall of 100% and precisionof 1%.

b,c and d, fantastic question
